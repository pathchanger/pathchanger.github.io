> "Learning and documenting **Mathematics, Philosophy, and Science** through my own perspective."

## 👋 About Me
I am a student at **Gangseo High School**. This GitHub space is a personal archive where I organize what I’ve learned and thought about. 

I am particularly interested in how **logic** (Math) and **human thought** (Philosophy) interact.
